This bundle was created using the [XSLT transform](StructureDefinition-VA.MHV.PHR.imaging.html#notes). The bundle is a transform of the [mock sample SOAP message](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/mhv-fhir-phr-mapping/blob/main/mocks/radiology.xml). For each DocumentReference in this bundle, you can find the imagingExamTO by looking for the DocumentReference.identifer value in the radiology.xml.
