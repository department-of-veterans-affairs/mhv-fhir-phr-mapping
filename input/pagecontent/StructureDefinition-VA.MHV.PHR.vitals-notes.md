- The [mock example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/mhv-fhir-phr-mapping/blob/main/mocks/vitals.xml) 
- maps to [VitalSignTO](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/mhv-np-via-wsclient/blob/development/src/main/resources/VIA_v4.0.7_uat.wsdl) schema.
- Mapping from [VitalSignTo](StructureDefinition-VA.MHV.PHR.vitals-mappings.html#mappings-for-via-to-mhv-fhir-phr-vitalsignto)
- based on US-Core for Vital-Signs Observation Resource
  - Blood-Pressure is based off of the Blood-Pressure profile
- should have `meta.profile` set to - JIRA
  - General Vital-Signs `https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/mhv-fhir-phr-mapping/StructureDefinition/VA.MHV.PHR.vitals`
  - Pain `https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/mhv-fhir-phr-mapping/StructureDefinition/VA.MHV.PHR.vitalsPain`
  - Blood-Pressure `https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/mhv-fhir-phr-mapping/StructureDefinition/VA.MHV.PHR.vitalsBP`
- `status` of `final`
- `category` code of `vital-signs`
- `code.text` the original `VitalSignTO.type.name`
  - `coding` is VUID if the id was 7 digits
  - `coding` should be LOINC if available
    - [Concept Map from VitalSignTO.type.name to LOINC code](ConceptMap-ObservationTypeTOVsLoincCode.html)
- must have `identifier` as cross reference to original source
- `subject` is the patient
- Not preserving the VitalSignTO.low and .high as they are referenceRange
- value
  - Blood Pressure - no `.value[x]`, but has `.component`
    - Additional specifics for [BP Vital-Signs](StructureDefinition-VA.MHV.PHR.vitalsBP.html)
      - [Examples](StructureDefinition-VA.MHV.PHR.vitalsBP-examples.html)
  - Pain - `.valueQuantity`
    - Additional specifics for [Pain Vital-Signs](StructureDefinition-VA.MHV.PHR.vitalsPain.html)
      - [Examples](StructureDefinition-VA.MHV.PHR.vitalsPain-examples.html)
  - Those with units use `.valueQuantity` else `.valueString`
- value units
  - There is a units within the data, and it seems mostly to be the proper code from the proper code system UCUM
  - some units are not proper formal UCUM, so I had to fix `lb` and `in` - [Utility UCUM](utility.html)
- populate `effectiveDateTime`, `performer`, and `note.text` as mapped 
- timestamp is confirmed to be date taken
- Most [examples are within a Bundle](Bundle-vitals.html), which does not exposed each vital sign.

#### Mapping Concerns

- Not clear how we learn of previously good vitals that should be changed and marked as entered-in-error
- There are examples, all of which have been converted into [FHIR resources](Bundle-vitals.html)
  - BLOOD PRESSURE (SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE) = 26 (26, 26)
  - HEIGHT = 12
  - WEIGHT = 20
  - PULSE = 20
  - PAIN = 16
  - RESPIRATION = 9
  - TEMPERATURE = 18
- do not have examples for -- **these are not required in the UX, so low priority**
  - ABDMONAL GIRTH
  - AUDIOMETRY
  - CENTRAL VENOUS PRESSURE
  - CIRCUMFERENCE%2FGIRTH
  - FETAL HEART TONES
  - FUNDAL HEIGHT
  - HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE
  - HEARING
  - PULSE OXIMETRY
  - RESPIRATION
  - TONOMETRY
  - VISION CORRECTED
  - VISION UNCORRECTED
- mock example didn't include these elements, so I don't map
  - type.shortName, type.dataId, type.dataName, or type.dataType
  - value2
  - facility
  - location
  - qualifiers, qualifierItems
- code should be LOINC if available
  - [Concept Map from VitalSignTO.type.name to LOINC code](ConceptMap-ObservationTypeTOVsLoincCode.html)
  - note some of these codes are high confidence, many are not
- value units
  - There is a units within the data, and it seems mostly to be the proper code from the proper code system UCUM
  - some units are not proper formal UCUM, so I had to fix `lb` and `in` - [Utility UCUM](utility.html)

#### code review

august 21, 2023

- identifier is not following the given pattern
- lines 214-229, seems to be prototype code that should be removed?
- lines 233-242, processing of identifier. I can't understand this code, but it does not seem to be putting the right pattern in.
- line 244, sets status final, will eventually need this to follow the status of updates
- lines 247-254, (category) is wrong. `vital-signs` is not a loinc code it is `http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/observation-category`
- lines 256-268, (code) is wrong. This code seems to be looking at the input name, but then just assuming it is loinc unless the name happens to be "X". I guess that this switch statement was going to implement the [mapping table](ConceptMap-ObservationTypeTOVsLoincCode.html) that I provide, but did not.
  - Note that this mapping table could be implemented as a FHIR ConceptMap, and thus be dynamically improved without changes to the code.
- line 270, This line seems to be consistent with allergy when the patient is new, but does not have the if statement tha allergy has.
- line 272-280, (effectiveDate), seems okay
- line 281-288, (recorder and observer), seems okay
- lines 289-295, (value), seems mostly okay for quantity, but should also handle string, blood pressure, and pain
  - for quantity, some units are not proper formal UCUM, so I had to fix `lb` and `in` - [Utility UCUM](utility.html)
- lines 301-310, This is code to just throw a warning if we see data we did not have a map to. Should this code go to production, or be disablable in production? It might be useful to detect information we don't have a map for.
- line 312 has "DocumentReference" but surely this is wrong, I guess this should be "Observation"?
