This Implementation Guide includes the FHIR profiles and  test plan for how MHV exposes the PHR. MHV is providing a FHIR Server API.

### Technical Overview

This includes the test plan, profiles of how MHV makes PHR available, examples that match those profiles, and examples that are good FHIR Resources that MHV should handle well.

This is work as part of [My Health Medical Records Product](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records) where business requirements can be found.

The main sections of this IG are:

- [API](api.html)
- [Vista Mapping](background.html)
- [Artifacts](artifacts.html)
- [TestPlan](testplan.html)
- [Downloads](downloads.html)

All MHV profiles are based on [HL7 FHIR US-Core](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU5.0.1/index.html) implementation guide, which provides guidance to the USA marketplace that VHA participates within.  Deeper explanation is provided in the US-Core specification.
