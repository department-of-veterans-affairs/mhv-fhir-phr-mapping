| ----- | ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0 | undefined |	Draft: the resource or profile (artifact) has been published on the current build. This level is synonymous with Draft | none
| 1 | Initial (chaotic, ad hoc, individual heroics) - the starting point for use of a new or undocumented repeat process | PLUS the artifact produces no warnings during the build process and has indicated that the artifact substantially complete and ready for implementation | none
| 2 | Repeatable - the process is at least documented sufficiently such that repeating the same steps may be attempted | Initially deployed in the test environment | started review
| 3 | Defined - the process is defined/confirmed as a standard business process | Deployed to production pilot |  resolved issues
| 4 | Capable - the process is quantitatively managed in accordance with the agreed-upon metrics | Production use |  approved
